<h3> Newton's Laws </h3>
<dl>
<dt> Newton's First law </dt>
    <dd> A body will remain in motion unless acted upon by another force and will remain at rest unless acted upon by another force </dd>
<dt> Newton's Second Law </dt>
    <dd> F = ma </dd>
<dt> Newton's Third Law </dt>
    <dd>Each action has an equal and opposite reaction</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Newton's Laws of Gravitation</h3>
<li>Two bodies attract each other with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass</li>
<br />
<ld><code> Fgrav = G(m1*m2)/r^2 </code></ld>

<h3>Newtons Laws and Kepler (and Halley's comet)</h3>
<li>Halley calculated the orbital path of Halley's comet
